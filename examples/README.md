This examples can help to understand how to use this library.
A documentation will be created later.

* filepath : it's the access file path that contain the assembly script code

##### To enter instructions on keyboard :

`./executable`

On execution :

* `exit` : stop execution
* `file <filepath>` : execute assembly code in a file
* `help` : diplay commands
* `instructions` : display instructions
* enter white line to execute previous code

### 2. Script
